You can get your preferred version of the release [here](https://github.com/Crystal15118/EverythingForMCSR/releases/latest) or you can get the `MCSR-all.zip` as it includes everything that you could ever need for speedrunning minecraft and is about ready to use.

## Safety & Security  
As the source files for releases are too big, we can't open source them. So, for your safety and securty if you are concerned with it, first unzip a release in a secure environment i.e. a virtual machine, etc. The files included in the zip will be listed in releases.
